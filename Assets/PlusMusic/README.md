The PlusMusic Developer Tools enable you to connect your game project with the 
PlusMusic Audio Library for quick and seamless adaptive audio integration.

If you don't already have a PlusMusic account, go over to https://www.plusmusic.ai/ 
and sign up to browse our catalog of over 300k soundtracks. 
Testing soundtracks in your game is free (they will be watermarked). 
We also have a free license for small games (up to 20 unique players) for test 
releases, game jams etc. with no watermarks.

Our soundtracks are segmented into arrangements that can be used to create dynamic, 
adaptive sounds. We use AI/ML algorithms to identify segments according to criteria 
such as mood, style, intensity etc. 
Those segments are then compiled into arrangements that can be used in your game project.

We currently offer 9 arrangement types for each song: 
full_song, backing_track, high_template, low_template, highlight, lowlight, preview, 
victory and failure.

In your game, you specify arrangements using scripting, triggers, blueprints etc, select 
transitions between them, add stingers, adjust volume and intensity using our predefined 
prefabs, scripts or blueprints to define a soundscape that is independent from the actual 
soundtrack that is playing. 

You can use our soundtracks simply as a backing track, switch soundtracks from a predefined 
list, play them at random or even allow the player to chose which soundtracks to play at runtime.
